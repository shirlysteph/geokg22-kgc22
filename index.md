# First Workshop on Geospatial Knowledge Graphs
### co-located with The Knowledge Graph Conference 2022 at Cornell Tech campus, New York, and globally online, from May 2 - 6, 2022

## Call for papers


We invite submissions to the First Workshop on Geospatial Knowledge Graphs (GeoKG2022) to be held in conjunction with the 
<a href="https://www.knowledgegraph.tech/">The Knowledge Graph Conference 2022 (KGC2022)</a> that will take place at Cornell Tech campus, New York, 
and globally online, from May 2 to 6, 2022. GeoKG2022 is a half-day workshop consisting of two parts: paper presentations, and an interactive breakout
discussion session.

The workshop aims to bring together disparate elements of the environmental and geospatial community and provide a setting to discourse about
large-scale knowledge graphs for geospatial and environmental data integration and intelligence, state-of-the-art, spatiotemporally-explicit machine
learning methods, tools, and their potential as well as limitations on addressing geospatial challenges. More specifically, the goal is to foster
discussion on frameworks for leveraging spatial and temporal knowledge as the nexus to integrate environmental data of various themes within geospatial
knowledge graphs.


## Topics:
We particularly welcome contributions on topics related to environmental data integration using knowledge graphs and geospatial 
intelligence services using innovative machine learning techniques. The main topics of interest are:


1) Geospatial Ontologies and Geospatial Knowledge Graph Construction
    - Spatiotemporal Scoping of GKGs
    - Ontologies to encode environmental observations and events in GeoKGs

2) Querying Geospatial Knowledge Graphs
    - GeoSPARQL and Spatial Query Evaluation
    - GeoKGs Visualizations

3) Machine Learning for Geospatial Knowledge Graphs
    - Geospatial Knowledge Graph Embeddings
    - Spatiotemporally-explicit Machine Learning Models for Environmental Tasks

4) Other GeoKG Topics and Applications
    - Real-world use cases of GeoKGs
    - Applications of Geospatial Knowledge Graphs (e.g. knowledge graphs in environmental data integration and AI systems)

## Submissions:
We invite the submission of original research results and industry-level applications related to the focus areas of the workshop, in one of two categories given below. All submissions are requested through EasyChair.

1) Short papers (maximum 5 pages LNCS style) presenting proposed research directions, novel ideas, use-case scenarios, established results or more general positions or discussions.

2) Vision papers (maximum 4 pages ) presenting important directions for future research on GeoKGs. Such papers should identify key problem areas for GeoKGs, and propose potential solutions or strategies that could be developed to address such problems. Ideally the papers should highlight open research questions for GeoKGs, and should stimulate future research.

Submissions should be sent to  geokg.kgc22@gmail.com
